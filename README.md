# Northwind_redo

The goal of this project will be to conduct business analysis for Northwind Traders, a ficticious company.

There are a number of business questions that will be assessed:
- Does discount amount have an impact on quantity of goods sold in an order?

This cleaner version will attempt to optimize the SQL queries - while I utilized Python to join data frames in the first round of analysis, I will use sqlite to manipulate the data first, reducing the code to be run following the queries.
