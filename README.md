# Northwind_redo

The goal of this project will be to conduct business analysis for Northwind Traders, a ficticious company.

There are a number of business questions that will be assessed:
- Does discount amount have an impact on quantity of goods sold in an order?

This cleaner version will attempt to optimize the SQL queries - while I utilized Python to join data frames in the first round of analysis, I will use sqlite to manipulate the data first, reducing the code to be run following the queries.

I also explore the possible gross profit margins seen across product categories and breakout the needed increase in quantity sold to match a discount provided given a possible existing profit margin. I estimate that Northwinds will have a gpm between 30-50% on goods sold, however, accessing real COGS would help better target that figure.
